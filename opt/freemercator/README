Overview 
========

This archive contains the source code and runtime components for the
FreeMercator Point of Sale, a standalone POS transaction engine. It
is a branch of the existing Mercator project.  

It utilizes an object oriented design intended to provide a foundation
for general retail POS operations. Currently the system supports POS
functionality similar to what you would see in an off-the-shelf
register from casio or royal but is based on relational database
technology, supports a graphical or non-graphical (POS peripherals)
user interface and implements a highly user extendable OO design.

Getting Started 
===============

The INSTALL file contains instructions and required components for
setting up a runtime environment and compiling the system. Mercator is
written in java so you need a java virtual machine (JVM). The initial
release is oriented towards a development environment so it talks in
terms of a JDK.
