1. How can I get the latest CVS snapshot of FM?
   
   Use you favorite cvs client with the following params:
   host:             cvs.sourceforge.net
   protocol:         :pserver:
   repository path:  /cvsroot/freemercator
   user:             anonymous
   password:         <empty>
   
   I suggest to use TortoiseCVS from 
   sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisecvs  (use stable version !!!)

2. Why do I get error "Cash in drawer limit exceeded"?
   
   Limit in cash drawer is one of the Pos Parameters
   and is separate for each config. Default limit is $100.
   In order to increase it, go to admin utility and change
   parameter "CashPickup" either for necessary configuration
   or for all.   
   
3. How can I change screen size?

   FM was designed to best fit 1024x768 screen size. Some size/width
   parameters are stored in db in respect to the default size, but they
   can be scaled to actual screen size. To change width/height, edit
   shared file 
   <share>/com.globalretailtech.pos.gui.PosFrame
   This will do most of work, but to look really good on you resolution,
   you will also have to change the following:
   - west.gif, east.gif, north.gif, south.gif in <share>/images
   - font size for most of gui elements, look into files in <share> dir
